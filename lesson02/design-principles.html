            <p>The Church of Jesus Christ's website displays a great showcase for
            Fitts' Law. This law is defined as the time that is required
            to move your fingers to place the buttons that pertain to the items that they
            are related to. For example the "Learn More" button is right underneath the 
            explanation for how Jesus's gospel can bless your life. </p>

            <p>Medium's website is about 1 thing, reading and writing. Because of this, 
                they get straight to the point. The layout is clean and easy to navigate,
                with a lot of white space that acts as breathing room around the elements.
